 * Practice with GUI component,

 * Think of Starcraft, there will be minimap like the game, 
 * There will be screen and the minimap, in the minimap, there is little box that indicates where in the map 
 * you are currently at. This will be generic enough to use it anywhere.
 * Mouse will be trapped in the screen, and can be released with certain command. 
 * I will develop this to sophisticated way of collision detecting
